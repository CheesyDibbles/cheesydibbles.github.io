  <h1>Teen Shot Dead In Police Shootout</h1>
  <p style=font-size:20px;">Yesterday night there was a police shootout in a vacant lot which resulted in the death of 17 year old Dallas Winston. Police say that he held up a empty gun 
    at<br>them signaling that he was going to shoot. Tim Bones, a police officer and first-hand witness to the incident had some words to say.<br>"We had him at 
     gunpoint, but he pulled up a gun and aimed it directly at us. We had no choice but to shoot."</p>
<p style=font-size:20px;">Some reporters say Dallas intentionally wanted to get shot due to his best friends death the same day. Another first-hand witness, Ponyboy Michael Curtis said <br>
    this: "It's not fair, I lost two friends in one night. Dally robbed a grocery store and he was on the run from the cops, we went to go hide him, but it was too late. The cops were already behind him<br>
    and within a split second he pulled out his heater and pointed it at the cops. He died before he hit the ground. I still remember him flopping to the ground, under that street lamp. Not soon after<br>
    I passed out." Dally will be having a funeral, set up by the Curtis Family next Sunday.<br>

   <h1> Church Fire Almost Ends In Fatality</h1>
   <p style=font-size:20px;">Over the weekend a church caught on fire in Windrixville. The source of the fire is believed to be a lit cigarette but it is yet to be confirmed by the fire department.<br>
     Five kids were in the church whilst it being on flame, but two boys dove in and saved the kids. Ponyboy Michael Curtis and Johnny Cade are to thank for this heroic act. Unfortunately both boys were<br>
     sent to the hospital. Jerry Wood, a teacher and a witness said this: "We were having a picnic and all of a sudden the church beside us caught on fire. We heard faint screams coming from inside of the<br>
     inside of the church. Before I could do anything, two boys ran in through a broken window and started throwing the kids out. One boy, Ponyboy, made it out safely, but the other, Johnny, came out with<br>
   a busted back. I don't think Johnny's going to live, but if he does, he'll be disabled his whole life."<br><br>Both boys were transported to the Tulsa General Hospital by an ambulance escort.</p>
