  <h1>Teen Shot Dead In Police Shootout</h1>
  <p style=font-size:20px;">Yesterday night there was a police shootout in a vacant lot which resulted in the death of 17 year old Dallas Winston. Police say that he held up a empty gun 
    at<br>them signaling that he was going to shoot. Tim Bones, a police officer and first-hand witness to the incident had some words to say.<br>"We had him at 
     gunpoint, but he pulled up a gun and aimed it directly at us. We had no choice but to shoot."</p>
<p style=font-size:20px;">Some reporters say Dallas intentionally wanted to get shot due to his best friends death the same day. Another first-hand witness, Ponyboy Michael Curtis said <br>
    this,<br>
    "It's not fair, I lost two friends in one night. Dally robbed a grocery store and he was on the run from the cops, we went to go hide him, but it was too late. The cops were already behind him<br>
    and within a split second he pulled out his heater and pointed it at the cops. He died before he hit the ground. I still remember him flopping to the ground, under that street lamp. Not soon after<br>
    I passed out." Dally will be having a funeral, set up by the Curtis Family next Sunday.
